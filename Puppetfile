# The Puppetfile is empty because all modules have been preinstalled on
# the master. This also facilitates operating the course in offline mode
# when students deploy their code from Puppetfactory. Code Manager will not
# attempt to connect to any external sites such as the Puppet Forge or
# GitHub.
