# The Puppetfile contents are commented out because all modules have
# been preinstalled on the master. This also facilitates operating the
# classroom in offline mode when students deploy their code from
# Puppetfactory. Code Manager will not attempt to connect to any external
# sites such as the Puppet Forge or GitHub.
#
# Online classroom students may uncomment the lines below, if desired.
#

# Installs the puppetlabs/mysql module from the Puppet Forge
# mod 'puppetlabs/mysql', '3.10.0'

# Installs the puppetlabs/vcsrepo module from its GitHub repository
# mod 'vcsrepo',
#   :git => 'https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vcsrepo'
